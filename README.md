### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Data Portfolio

I am a data scientist with a background in naval architecture. With 6 years of experience in the maritime industry, I've developed a keen sense of problem-solving and a meticulous approach to analysis. Now, I've transitioned into the data science domain, leveraging my past experience to bring unique insights and methodologies to the table.
